========================

Ticketing done wrong, done right.

# About

# Why does this exist?
Definitely not for these reasons:
* TTCConnect's validation is laughably terrible
* TTCConnect is poorly designed and looks terrible
* TTCConnect was a waste of time and money that should have been put towards a real Presto rollout
* Seriously, who thought this was a good idea?
