Transit Ticket Cimulator
========================

Ticketing done wrong, done right.

# About
Transit Ticket Cimulator, or TTC (not to be confused with the TTC, or Toronto Transit Commission), is the easiest way to simulate the purchase of a valid TTC day pass purchase!

# Demo
Check out the YouTube video!

# Why?
Definitely not for these reasons:
* TTCConnect's validation is laughably terrible
* TTCConnect is poorly designed and looks terrible
* TTCConnect was a waste of time and money that should have been put towards a real Presto rollout
* Seriously, who thought this was a good idea?
